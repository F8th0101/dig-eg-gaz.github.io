What We Have So Far
---

Thus far, our group would like to form a strong correlation between our projects that we can talk about through common XPath and visualization research methods. Specifically, we're thinking about all using a common XPath Query and Visualization form that we can then analyze and reflect on its usefulness in each of our individual projects, and ultimately in the group as a whole. 

We are thinking about either doing a XPath query like //div[matches(.,'word', 'i')]/@feature, where each of us would use our word(s) of interest. Or, we could do something like //div[@type="page"][@n="3"]//div[matches(.,'word', 'i')]. Then, we would make sure to make nearly identical visualizations based on the data we yield from these queries. The latter query may be the most useful since most of our projects pertain to information on the third page of the *Gazette*. 

Once we have a common thread between our projects such as the previously mentioned, we can do a deeper dive into the digital research methodology and overall whether it was effective. Hopefully, we will come across more similarities between our projects along the way that we could possibly incorporate into our group analysis as well.
